##Introduction

All notebooks run in Jupyter Notebook and are written in Python
Notebooks are independent from one another. They are intended to be used with the data set from Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques found here

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

download and add train.csv and test.csv from the link above before using this project.

**The only exception is cleaning.ipynb which outputs the data sets without null values and with coverted categorical values using Python's LabelEncoder. This must be run to use the LightGBM_Modeling.ipynb notebook.

All libraries used are included in the source code and may need to be updated or added to your Python intepreter to utilize.
